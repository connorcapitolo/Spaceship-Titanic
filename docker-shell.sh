#!/bin/bash

# since this file is being run as an executable in a Unix operating system, the shebang (#!) lets the program loader mechanism know that the rest of the line should be run as an interpreter directive/executable; it specifies what program should be called to run the script
# in this particular case, /bin/bash is the most common shell (a shell allows you to run programs, give them input, and inspect their output in a semi-structured way) for user login of the Linux system. The term 'bash' is an acronym for Bourne-again shell, and it can access the vast majority of scripts since it is well developed with good syntax and features

# `docker build` is saying to build a Docker image
# `-t $IMAGE_NAME` is the equivalent of `-t "connorcapitolo-jupyter"`, and it is saying to tag the Docker image that we create from the Dockerfile as with the repository name "connorcapitolo-jupyter"; what this is missing is actually a "tag", which is would be something like "$IMAGE_NAME$:latest to let us know what version of this is being used
# `-f Dockerfile .` is specifying to look inside the current directory (this is specified by the dot) for the Dockerfile, and the instructions inside the Dockerfile should be executed

docker build -t $IMAGE_NAME -f Dockerfile .

# `docker run` is specifying to run a Docker container
#  `--rm --name $IMAGE_NAME` is saying to delete the container $IMAGE_NAME when it has stopped running
# '-v' is saying to mount a volume; we are mounting the current working directory into the container, so even if we put anything in this particular folder (spaceship-titanic/) it will be seen in the container; this will allow us to see any Notebook updates reflected on our local machine
# '-it' instructs Docker to allocate a pseudo-TTY connected to the containerâ€™s stdin; creating an interactive bash shell in the container
# '--name' is the name of the container; the container and the image could have different names b/c you can have multiple containers from a single image
# the second '$IMAGE_NAME' is what is actually saying to run the image
