# --mount=type=cache: using BUILDKIT, getting this speedup because we are no longer downloading all the Python packages. They were cached by the package manager (pip in this case) and stored in a cache volume mount. The volume mount is provided to the run step so that pip can reuse our already downloaded packages. This happens outside any Docker layer caching
